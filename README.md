# DKK Rust Bot
Simple discord bot made for me and my friends when we play Rust, using Battlemetrics API.
 
# Feature(s)
Currently the only feature is an Enemy Checker, which checks if the enemies you have added to your enemy list are online or offline.
- We mostly use this for offline raiding (Because we are noobs :D)

# How to use:
1. Add your discord bot token and enemy checker channel id in 'core > bot_settings.py'
2. Add your enemies on your list by using the commands on the bot '.enemy add (name)' (Use .help to see all commands)
3. Set your battlemetrics server id by doing the command '.server set (id)'
 
This bot was made private for me and my friends, but why not just publish it here on github. Changes will be made for the bot soon, so it's easier to use.
I will probably add other features aswell and publish them.
